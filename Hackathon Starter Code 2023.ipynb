    "## Introduction (Alcohol Consumption Example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alcohol consumption is a significant public health issue and a leading cause of preventable death and illness worldwide. The social environment, including peer norms and motives, is a crucial factor influencing alcohol consumption. Computational modeling provides a powerful tool for understanding the complex interplay between individual and social factors in shaping alcohol consumption behavior. In this hackathon, we will explore the role of social norms and motives in predicting alcohol consumption using agent-based modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by defining a Person class that represents an agent in our model. Each person has attributes such as their age, gender, and drinking behavior. We will use a simple approach where the person's drinking behavior is represented as a continuous variable between 0 and 1, where 0 represents abstaining from alcohol, and 1 represents heavy drinking. The person's perception of social norms and motives will also be represented as continuous variables between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will define a SocialNorms class that represents the agent-based model. The model will consist of a population of Person agents who are connected to each other through social networks. The social networks will be represented as a graph, where each person's connections will be determined by the type of relationship they have with others (e.g., friends, family, colleagues).\n",
    "\n",
    "The SocialNorms model will simulate the spread of social norms and motives within the population over time. At each time step, each person's drinking behavior will be updated based on their current perception of social norms and motives and their susceptibility to social influence. We will use a simple model where the person's drinking behavior is influenced by the average drinking behavior of their social network, with the strength of influence depending on the type of relationship (e.g., close friends have a stronger influence than distant acquaintances)."

Social norms, which are the unwritten rules of behavior that are followed by members of a group or society, can be strong predictors of alcohol consumption behavior among college students. \n",

This study found that both descriptive norms (i.e., the perceived prevalence of alcohol consumption) and injunctive norms (i.e., the perceived approval of drinking by peers) independently predicted alcohol consumption among college students. Furthermore, injunctive norms were further divided into distal (socially distant peers) and proximal (socially close peers), and proximal injunctive norms were found to have a stronger effect on drinking behavior than distal injunctive norms.\n",
