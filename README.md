# Computational Science Modelling Hackathon 2023

## Awards: 

We will award two prizes to the best teams (based on voting):
    1st prize: 50 Euro voucher 
    2nd prize: 25 Euro voucher 
The vouchers can be used to celebrate your success with some drinks and snacks in the Oerknal/Polder(????)

## Schedule and location:

15:00-17:45 you can work in four rooms SP L1.07, L1.12, L2.06, L2.07
17:45 pizza and drinks outside the lecture room L1.01
18:00-18:45 your 5-min presentation in room SP L1.01 

## General idea:

You will work in teams of 4 students. Please register your team on Canvas (People - Groups - Hackathon teams)
  
We booked 4 rooms, so the teams can sit at some distance from each other and talk without disturbing others. Please pick any room you like, avoid overcrowding. We will visit these 4 rooms to answer your questions. 

You are free to use any programming language, toolkit and visualization tool. 

## Presentation: 

At 18:00 you will present the results. Every team will have only about 5 minutes. Try to visualise your results, as this is the quickest way to get information across. After the presentations, everybody can vote for the best team. Based on the voting results, we will award prizes to the winners. 

If you have questions at any point, feel free to ask. Happy modelling!

# Introduction:

Social interactions play a critical role in shaping opinions, beliefs, and behaviors of individuals. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing models to better understand how social influence works and how it can be harnessed to promote positive change in communities. In this hackathon, participants will explore the dynamics of social influence on alcohol consumption using a simple agent-based model.

## Description:

The provided code snippet defines an agent-based model to simulate social interactions in a network of agents. Each agent has an opinion and a behavior, which are initialized to random values. At each time step, an agent updates its opinion and behavior based on the opinions and behaviors of its neighbors. Participant can extend and modify the model to explore various aspects of social influence. 

For example, participants may investigate how the topology of the network affects the spread of opinions and behaviors, or how the strength of social influence varies with different types of agents. Additionally, participants may explore the impact of external factors, such as media or advertising, on the dynamics of social influence.

Some additional behaviors or interactions are also suggested in the Jupyter Notebook.
