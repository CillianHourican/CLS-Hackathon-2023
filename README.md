# CLS-Hackathon-2023

## General Rules
You have untill 17:45 to work on your model in teams. You can stay in the lecture room or somewhere nearby. At 17:45 everybody comes back to the lecture room and we start presenting the results. Every team only has about 5 minutes to show interesting results and things they did, so use your time wisely! Try to put an emphasis on visualisation of your results, as this is the quickest way to get information across.

Cillian, Parva and Lera will hang out in the lecture room to answer your questions. During work, you can stay in the lecture room or work with your teammates nearby. For the coding and modelling, you are free to use any programming language, toolkit and visualization tool (as long as it's your own work). For the presentation part, all visualization forms are allowed if you can share it with the audience. Lera and Cillian will judge your work and presentation and award prizes for the winners.

If you have questions at any point, feel free to ask. Happy modelling!

# Introduction:

Social interactions play a critical role in shaping opinions, beliefs, and behaviors of individuals. In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing models to better understand how social influence works and how it can be harnessed to promote positive change in communities. In this hackathon, participants will explore the dynamics of social influence on alcohol consumption or obesity (you choose!) using a simple agent-based model.

## Description:

The provided code snippet defines an agent-based model to simulate social interactions in a network of agents. Each agent has an opinion and a behavior, which are initialized to random values. At each time step, an agent updates its opinion and behavior based on the opinions and behaviors of its neighbors. Participant can extend and modify the model to explore various aspects of social influence. 

For example, participants may investigate how the topology of the network affects the spread of opinions and behaviors, or how the strength of social influence varies with different types of agents. Additionally, participants may explore the impact of external factors, such as media or advertising, on the dynamics of social influence.

Some additional behaviors or interactions are also suggested in the Jupyter Notebook.
